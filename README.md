# TshFNA-Examiner: Analyze Thyroid Cytopathology Image with Deep Learning Approache

In the TshFNA-Examiner, cellular-intensive areas strongly correlated with diagnostic medical information are detected by a nuclei segmentation neural network; cell-level image patches are catalogued following The Bethesda System for Re-porting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC) system by a classification neural network, which is
further enhanced by leveraging unlabeled data.The system comprises three functional blocks of cancer risk classification and cellular segmentation. The source images will be released soon.
