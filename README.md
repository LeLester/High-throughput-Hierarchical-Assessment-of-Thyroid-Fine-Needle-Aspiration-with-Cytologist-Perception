# High-throughput Hierarchical Assessment of Thyroid Fine Needle Aspiration with Cytologist-Perception Incorporated Deep Learning

A high-throughput thyroid FNA diagnostic system is designed to methodologically pattern after cytologists' examination. Global salient informative regions are first located, followed by the quantitative cancer risk estimation according to The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC) system. The system comprises three functional blocks of cancer risk classification, cellular segmentation, and cellularity heatmap prediction.
